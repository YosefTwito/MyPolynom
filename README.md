# MyPolynom
Created as an Object-Oriented-Programming Project during the second year at Ariel University
in the Department of Computer Science, 2019.

## Overview
This project is about Polynoms and polynomial Complex Functions, creating and handling them in Java, including some
useful functions (Drawing, Computing area, etc..) described in the wiki pages.

The main purpose of my project is to visually draw polynomial functions.
I used StdDraw from (https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/) to make a new window and print functions on it.
